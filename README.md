# cigar2
This is from a file called "lottery2," in which I will attempt to draw a winning number and compare it with 1,000 randomly generated entries.
The 1,000 is no magic number; it could be 10 or 100.
I will compare the winning number with the entrants for any full matches, and for the number of one-offs.
As assigned, I will use a string function, an array function and a hash function.
